# Startups-Funding-Prediction

# Problem Description
There has been a staggering growth in investments in young age startups in the last 5 years. A lot of big VC firms are increasingly getting interested in the startup funding space. Here the task is to predict whether a startup will get a funding in the next three months using app traction data and startup details. This funding can be either seed funding, Series A, Series B, so on and so forth.



# Important works/ Conclusion :
Built two separate Machine Learning systems to classify if a startup would be funded within next three months, with a recall accuracy of 98% for both models. Developed a Missing value Imputer similar to KNN Imputer and conducted investment analysis to understand investors' interest and factors affecting. Applied Smote and SmoteNC for imbalanced data including other feature engineering techniques like scaling and normalization to explore various Classification models such as Gradient Boosting, XG Boost, and Cat Boost. Obtained Model Reason Codes(MRCs) by leveraging the novel concept of SHAP values and SHAP charts such as summary, interaction, and force plots to come up with the best explanation for model predictions.
